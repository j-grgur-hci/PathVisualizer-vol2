# Pathfinding Algorithms Visualization

React application developed for visualizing four pathfinding algorithms as part of the **final thesis**.

## Features

- Visualize four pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*.
- Contribute to in-depth knowledge of algorithms and React development skills.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate independent problem-solving through application implementation.
- Contribute to academic and practical understanding of algorithms.

## Algorithm Descriptions

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
  
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Ideal for traversing graphs and solving maze problems.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Effective for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.

- **A* Algorithm:** A heuristic-based approach widely used in robotics and gaming for pathfinding.
