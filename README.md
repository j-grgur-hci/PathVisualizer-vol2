##### P.S. WORK IN PROGRESS
### MOTIVATION
Motivation behind creating an app in React that visualizes 4 pathfinding algorithms, was the Algorithms class itself.
Many underestimate the usage of algorithms, maybe because of the lack of knowledge or maybe because they have difficulty understanding them.
### THE GOAL
Many of us are visual learners, and that's where this app comes in handy. It shows 4 pathfinding algorithms : BFS, DFS, Dijkstra and A*, but not only does it show their implementation on a grid, it also offers interesting informations about them.
